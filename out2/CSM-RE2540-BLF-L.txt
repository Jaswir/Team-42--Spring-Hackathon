G ENERAL HANDLING PROCEDURES
 Elements contained in the boxes must be kept dry  Keep elements moist at all times after initial wetting.
at room temperature (7–32°C; 40–95°F) and should
not be stored in direct sunlight.  Avoid excessive pressure and flow spikes.
 For WET-TYPE, the preservative solution (1%  Only use chemicals compatible with the membrane
sodium metabisulfite solution) is added to prohibit elements and components. Use of such chemicals
the growth of micro-organisms. may void the element limited warranty.
 Permeate from the first hour of operation should  Permeate pressure must always be equal or less than
be discarded. the feed/concentrate pressure. Damage caused by
permeate back pressure voids the element limited
 Stabilized salt rejection is generally achieved within warranty.
1~48 hours of continuous use.
 The element shell is FRP(Fiber Reinforced Plastic). Be
aware of glass fiber strands and use safety equipment.
