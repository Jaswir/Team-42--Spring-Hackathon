†The above saturation limits are typically accepted by proprietary antiscalant
manufacturers. It is the user’s responsibility to ensure proper chemica(ls) and
concentration are dosed ahead of the membrane system to prevent scale
formation anywhere within the membrane system. Membrane elements fouled
or damaged due to scale formation are not covered by the limited warranty .

(cid:31) Elements should be immersed in a preservative solution
during storage, shipping and system shutdowns to prevent
biological growth and freezing. The standard storage
solution contains 1% by weight sodium bisulfite or sodium
metabisulfite (food grade). For short term storage (i.e.
one week or less) 1% by weight sodium metabisulfite
solution is adequate for preventing bioloigcal growth.
