Saturation Limits · Langlier Saturation Index (LSI) <+1.5
(Using Antiscalants) †
· Stiff and Davis Saturation Index (SDSI) <+0.5
· CaSO4 230% saturation
· SrSO4 800% saturation
· BaSO4 6,000% saturation
· SiO2 100% saturation
†The above saturation limits are typically accepted by proprietary antiscalant
manufacturers. It is the user’s responsibility to ensure proper chemical(s) and
concentration are dosed ahead of the membrane system to prevent scale
formation anywhere within the membrane system. Membrane elements fouled
or damaged due to scale formation are not covered by the limited warranty .

(cid:31) Elements should be immersed in a preservative solution
during storage, shipping and system shutdowns to preve nt
biological growth and freezing. The standard storage
solution contains 1% by weight sodium bisulfite or sodium
metabisulfite (food grade). For short term storage (i.e.
one week or less) 1% by weight sodium metabisulfite
solution is adequate for preventing biological growth .
