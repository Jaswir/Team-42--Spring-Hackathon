RE2812-300
RO element for residential use
S PECIFICATIONS
General Features
Permeate Flow Rate GPD (L/Day) 350 GPD (1,325L/day)
NaCl Rejection % 97% (Minimum 95%)
Membrane Type Thin-Film Composite
Membrane Material Polyamide (PA)

The stated product performance is based on data taken after 30 minutes of operation at the following test Conditions: 200 mg/L NaCl solution at 60
psig (0.41 MPa) applied pressure; 15% recovery; 77℉ (25℃); pH 6.5–7.0; Permeate flow rate for each element may vary +25 / -15%; Minimum salt
rejection is 95.0%; All elements are vacuum leak tested using the CSM integrity test; Elements can be supplied as dry or wet-type. Wet-tested elements
are soaked in a preservative solution (1.0% food grade SBS) and vacuum sealed in a poly bag. All elements are individually boxed.
