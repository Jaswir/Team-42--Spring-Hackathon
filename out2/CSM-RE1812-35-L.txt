1.The stated product performance is based on data taken after 30 minutes of operationa t the following
test conditions:
• 200 mg/L NaCl solution at 60 psig (0.41 MPa) applied pressure
• 15% recovery
• 77 oF (25 oC)
• pH 6.5 –7.0
2. Minimum salt rejection is 96.0%.
3. Dry type elements are vacuum leak tested usingt he San Diego Protocol.
4. Permeate flow rate for each element may vary but will be no more than 15%.
