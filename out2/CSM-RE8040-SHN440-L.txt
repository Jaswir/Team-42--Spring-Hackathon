†The above saturation limits are typically accepted by proprietary antiscalant
manufacturers. It is the user’s responsibility to ensure proper chemical(s) and
concentration are dosed ahead of the membrane system to prevent scale
formation anywhere within the membrane system. Membrane elements fouled
or damaged due to scale formation are not covered by the limited warranty.
GENERAL HANDLING PROCEDURES
(cid:122) Elements contained in the boxes must be kept dry at (cid:122) Only use chemicals compatible with the membrane
room temperature (7–32°C; 40–95°F) and should not be elements and components. Use of such chemicals may
stored in direct sunlight. If the polyethylene bag is void the element limited warranty.
damaged, a new preservative solution (sodium bisulfite)
must be added and air-tight sealed to prevent drying and (cid:122) Permeate pressure must always be equal or less than the
feed/concentrate pressure. Damage caused by permeate
biological growth.
back pressure voids the element limited warranty.
(cid:122) Permeate from the first hour of operation should be
discarded to flush out the preservative solution.
(cid:122) Elements should be immersed in a preservative solution
during storage, shipping and system shutdowns to prevent
biological growth and freezing. The standard storage
solution contains 1% by weight sodium bisulfite or sodium
metabisulfite (food grade). For short term storage (i.e.
one week or less) 1% by weight sodium metabisulfite
solution is adequate for preventing biological growth.
(cid:122) Keep elements moist at all times after initial wetting.
(cid:122) Avoid excessive pressure and flow spikes.
