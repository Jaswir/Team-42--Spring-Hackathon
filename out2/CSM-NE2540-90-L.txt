(cid:31) Elements should be immersed in a preservative solution
during storage, shipping and system shutdowns to prevent
biological growth and freezing. The standard storage
solution contains 1% by weight sodium bisulfite or sodium
metabisulfite (food grade). For short term storage (i.e.
one week or less) 1% by weight sodium metabisulfite
solution is adequate for preventing biologicl agrowth.
