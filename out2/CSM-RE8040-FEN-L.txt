1. The stated performance is initial data taken after 30 minutes of operation based on the following conditions;
2,000 mg/L NaCl solution at 225 psig (1.5 MPa) applied pressure, 15 % recovery, 77 oF (25 oC) and pH 6.5~7.0.
2. Minimum salt rejection is 99.4%.
3. Permeate Flow rate for individual elements may vary but will be no more than 10 below the value shown.
4. Effective membrane area may vary within 3 %.
5. All elements are vacuum sealed in a polyethylene bag containing 1.0 % SBS (Sodium bisulfite) solution and packaged individually
in a cardboard box.

Features
(cid:122)
CSM FEn element provides an excellent way to treat a feed water having relatively high fouling
potential due to the remaining colloidal, biological and organic fouling agents even after controlled
pretreatment.
(cid:122)
CSM FEn element has a high durability against CIP chemicals to sustain fouling resistant performance
even after periodic CIP in a long term operation
