G ENERAL HANDLING PROCEDURES
 Elements contained in the boxes must be kept dry  Avoid excessive pressure and flow spikes.
at room temperature (7–32°C; 40–95°F) and should
not be stored in direct sunlight.  Only use chemicals compatible with the membrane

 Permeate pressure must always be equal or less than
 Stabilized salt rejection is generally achieved within the feed/concentrate pressure. Damage caused by
1~48 hours of continuous use. permeate back pressure voids the element limited
warranty.
 Keep elements moist at all times after initial
wetting.  The element shell is FRP(Fiber Reinforced Plastic). Be
aware of glass fiber strands and use safety equipment.
