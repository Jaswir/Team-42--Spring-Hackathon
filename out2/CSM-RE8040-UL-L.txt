1. The stated product performance is based on data taken after 30 minutes of operation at the following
test conditions:
• 1,500 mg/L NaCl solution at 150 psig (1.0 MPa) applied pressure
• 15% recovery
• 77 oF (25 oC)
• pH 6.5–7.0
2. IPA rejection is 92.0% after 2 hours of operation at the following test conditions:
• 1,000 mg/L IPA solution at 225 psig (1.5 MPa) applied pressure
• 15% recovery
• 77 oF (25 oC)
• pH 6.5–7.0
3. Minimum salt rejection is 98.5%.
4. Permeate flow rate for each element may vary but will be no more than 10% below the value shown.
5. All elements are vacuum sealed in a polyethylene bag containing 1.0% SBS (sodium bisulfite) solution
and individually packaged in a cardboard box.

Saturation Limits
†
· Langlier Saturation Index (LSI) <+1.5
(Using Antiscalants) · Stiff and Davis Saturation Index (SDSI) <+0.5
· CaSO4 230% saturation
· SrSO4 800% saturation
· BaSO4 6,000% saturation
· SiO2 100% saturation
†The above saturation limits are typically accepted by proprietary antiscalant
manufacturers. It is the user’s responsibility to ensure proper chemical(s) and
concentration are dosed ahead of the membrane system to prevent scale
formation anywhere within the membrane system. Membrane elements fouled
or damaged due to scale formation are not covered by the limited warranty.

Elements should be immersed in a preservative solution
during storage, shipping and system shutdowns to prevent
biological growth and freezing. The standard storage
solution contains 1% by weight sodium bisulfite or sodium
metabisulfite (food grade). For short term storage (i.e.
one week or less) 1% by weight sodium metabisulfite
solution is adequate for preventing biological growth.
