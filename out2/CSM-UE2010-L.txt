The stated product performance is based on data taken after 30 minutes of operation at the following test Conditions: Pure water (2 ㏁) at 20 psig
applied pressure; 100% recovery; 77℉ (25℃); Permeate flow rate for each element may vary +15 / -15%; Elements are only supplied as Wet-type. Wet-
tested elements are soaked in a preservative solution (1.0% food grade SBS) and vacuum sealed in a poly bag. All elements are individually boxed.
